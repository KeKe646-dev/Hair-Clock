My clock is a representation of the journy of hair. The clock is meant to show how our hair can change in legnth and color as it does once washed or previously dyed. I personal dye my hair very often and I would notice how much time has passed when I saw my hair dye fading out and slowly returning to my natural color. Additonally the legnth of my hair would also determine how much time has passed as my I can see the diffrence in legnth and texture as my hair would grow out.
I chose to design this design using hatsune miku as an exsample just because it is easier to demonstrate the change of hair when the hair is long and in a noticable color. Previous design ideas I thought of was making a sound clock which would play ceartin sounds depening on when a minute has passed, an hour has passed, and a second has passed. I had difficultys figuring out how to code sounds that would interact with a time. 
My overall thoughts on this project is that visuals help us understand time better due to being able to see a change in front of our eyes.
